# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration
#
# The OTEL Collector receives telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces) from applications
# and forwards them to backend systems like Loki and Tempo.

receivers:
  # OTLP receiver accepts telemetry data in OpenTelemetry Protocol format
  otlp:
    protocols:
      # HTTP endpoint on port 4318 (our services will send data here)
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
      # gRPC endpoint on port 4317 (alternative protocol)
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

processors:
  # Batch processor groups multiple telemetry records together
  # This is more efficient than sending each log/trace individually
  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 100

exporters:
  # Export logs to Loki using OTLP format
  otlphttp/loki:
    endpoint: http://loki:3100/otlp
    tls:
      insecure: true

  # Export traces to Tempo using OTLP format
  otlp/tempo:
    endpoint: tempo:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

  # Debug exporter prints telemetry to console (useful for troubleshooting)
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  # Define pipelines for different telemetry signals
  pipelines:
    # Logs pipeline: OTLP receiver -> batch processor -> Loki exporter
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/loki, debug]

    # Traces pipeline: OTLP receiver -> batch processor -> Tempo exporter
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/tempo, debug]
